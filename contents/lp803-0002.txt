Not until the day did I browse Feng's photo gallery at his laptop, upon his invitation. I noticed a lot of unpublished photos in his previous BDSM photography sessions with other players, which, both parties were believed to keep them secret, as he said. I didn't ask for digital copies, as seeing them from time to time at his laptop was believed to be enough. (Well, no pun intended.)

Scrolling down to the first pieces of the album, I noticed his early works, which were still immature in style, unleashed a strong sexual surge in me, and led to an unsuccessful erection against the cage under my briefs.

Because the birthmark on his waist looked familiar.

"Wait, this guy looks familiar to me..." I whimpered.

"Huh, perhaps."

It just sounded like that he could neither confirm nor deny, which, always meant, true.

Just when I was considering what he meant and what I saw, the lock on the door of our room spun and I heard the noise. I quitted the Photos application on the laptop a few milliseconds before we figured out that it was our roommate Tao Zhou who was coming in.

"Whoa, a rare pair." Tao laughed to us, his glasses reflecting the twilight.

"Ready for tomorrow's presentation?" Feng greeted back.

The random chats continued and we three had dinner together, then went for gymming. And I realized that the birthmark I saw was same to the one of Tao which I once had a glimpse when taking shower.

I had to suspect. Things were getting interesting.
